# Mg

This is my fork of the OpenBSD `mg` text editor. It's mainly for personal use and its pretty complete but feel free to suggest anything or open any issues if you feel it is neccessary.

## Configuration
If you want to make major changes (function definitions etc), it might be worth you just forking the code. For keymappings you can edit the `keymap.c` file to your liking. It is currently set up how I use it.
